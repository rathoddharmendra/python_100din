Combine Google Trends with other Time Series Data

* Google trends gives us an estimate of search volume. Let's compare search volume with other relevant datasets to see hidden relations in them.

 Perhaps there are patterns in Google's search volume and the price of Bitcoin or a hot stock like Tesla. Perhaps search volume for the term "Unemployment Benefits" can tell us something about the actual unemployment rate?

 Data Sources:

Unemployment Rate from FRED
Google Trends
