In this sample project, we did -

1. Created new Kafka, Zookeeper and UI infrastructure
2. Publilshed data to test-topic - producer 
3. Read all data from kafka topic and dumped into a database table - consumer


TODO:
1. add schema to producer

This practical code, shows how data can be dumped from producer to a persistent storage using Kakfa for fan-out subscription or to leverage other benefits of using Kafka
> Producer -> Kafka bin -> Database table
