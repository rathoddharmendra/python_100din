# attribute is an variable attached to an object
user_1.username = 'dee'

class attribute and object attributes

class constructor or initialization for all the attributes that object will need

self is representing the actual object

-> converting : dict object to class object to reduce errors and typos as objects given attributes are more hard set, and foolproofs the solution file  --> good practice

-> breaking classes based on the main thing trying to solve:
    in coffee machine --> MenuItem() class to model drinks
    in quiz game --> Question() class to model questions 
    **individual units into a class model object**
